Measuring Distance with Ultrasonic Sensor and Active LED/Buzzer
This project uses an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to measure distance accurately. When an object is detected within 10 centimeters, an LED lights up and a buzzer sounds an alert. The setup is ideal for obstacle detection, proximity alarms, or smart distance-based automation projects.

Components Used:

Arduino (or any microcontroller)

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

LED

Buzzer

Resistors

Breadboard and jumper wires

Working Principle:
The ultrasonic sensor emits a sound wave and measures the time it takes to bounce back from an object. The distance is calculated based on the time, and if the distance is â‰¤ 10 cm, the LED and buzzer are activated.

Feel free to fork the repo, suggest improvements, or use this as a base for your own project!
